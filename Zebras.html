     <h3>My personal bond with Zebras</h3>
     I never really cared for zebras, until one day I decided that my short hair was boring and I had to come up with something new. Then my sister asked me, if I didn't want to dye a pattern in my hair. I have seen it from some celebrities before and 
     it was different from anything i have seen yet. So I agreed. First, I had to bleach my hair blond, which hurt a bit, and afterwards put the black dye in it. I decided to go for a zebra pattern, I didn't really have a reason why, I just thought it looked cool.
     But from there on, zebras integrated more and more in my life. We had to make a presentation about an animal in biology and I took the Zebra, which was great, because i learned a lot about the so called "horse tiger". They were actually interesting
     animals. A few weeks later, I was on a online marketplace and saw some zebra Nikes for a relatively low price and I just knew I had to go for them. So yeah, this is the story why I like zebras that much.

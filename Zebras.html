     <h3>My personal bond with Zebras</h3>
     I never really cared for zebras, until one day I decided that my short hair was boring and I had to come up with something new. Then my sister asked me, if I didn't want to dye a pattern in my hair. I have seen it from some celebrities before and 
     it was different from anything i have seen yet. So I agreed. First, I had to bleach my hair blond, which hurt a bit, and afterwards put the black dye in it. I decided to go for a zebra pattern, I didn't really have a reason why, I just thought it looked cool.
     But from there on, zebras integrated more and more in my life. We had to make a presentation about an animal in biology and I took the Zebra, which was great, because i learned a lot about the so called "horse tiger". They were actually interesting
     animals. A few weeks later, I was on a online marketplace and saw some zebra Nikes for a relatively low price and I just knew I had to go for them. So yeah, this is the story why I like zebras that much.

    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    Zebras are primarily found in Africa, with their distribution spanning from southern Ethiopia and Sudan to South Africa. They inhabit a variety of habitats, from grasslands to savannas and woodlands. Different species of zebras, like the plains zebra, Grevy's zebra, and mountain zebra, have distinct ranges across the continent, adapting to their specific environments.

    <h3>Pattern</h3>
    Zebras boast a striking black-and-white stripe pattern that distinguishes them from other animals. These bold stripes serve as both camouflage and a defense mechanism, confusing predators and making it challenging for them to single out an individual zebra. Each zebra's stripe pattern is unique, akin to a fingerprint, aiding in individual identification.

    <h3>Facts</h3>
    Zebras are herbivorous mammals known for their social behavior. They live in family groups, relying on safety in numbers to ward off predators. Zebras have excellent hearing and sight, allowing them to detect danger from afar. Their distinctive mane stands upright and can signal their mood or excitement, while they communicate with vocalizations like barking.
